The culture of Indonesia
The culture of Indonesia has been shaped by long interaction between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. Indonesia is centrally-located along ancient trading routes between the Far East, South Asia, and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, and Christianity, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hindu Javanese Abangan belief, the fusion of Hinduism, Buddhism and animism in Bodha, and the fusion of Hinduism and animism in Kaharingan. Balinese dances have stories about ancient Buddhist, and Hindu kingdoms, while Islamic art forms and architecture are present in Sumatra, especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions. Traditional art, music, and sport are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat.
The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science, technology and modern entertainment such as television shows, film, and music, as well as political system and issues. India has notably influenced Indonesian songs and movies. A popular type of song is the Indian-rhythmical dangdut, which is often mixed with Arab and Malay folk music.
Despite the influences of foreign culture, some remote Indonesian regions still preserve uniquely indigenous culture. Indigenous ethnic groups Mentawai, Asmat, Dani, Dayak, Toraja, and many others are still practicing their ethnic rituals, customs and wearing traditional clothes.
Drinking Water
Water becomes the popular drink after soft drink in some countries. People believe that it is good to drink eight glasses of water a day to keep our body moisturized and healthy. However, drinking eight glasses of water a day was nothing more than a guideline, not based on scientific evidence. Water gives us many benefits.
 First, water could aid weight loss. By drinking water before having a meal, you can lose your weight. This is because extra H2O helps us eatless by making us feel full and boost metabolism. Second, water keeps digest healthy. Water helps dissolve fats and soluble fiber. Water also flushes waste product that prevents constipation and reduce the burden on our kidneys and liver. 
The last, water prevents headache naturally. We sometimes get migraine. Migraine is caused, sometimes, by not drinking water for too long. Water helps our headache by drinking two to four cups of water for headache relief within one to two hours. Water is the healthiest beverage in the world. You will get nothing from water but benefits for your health.
TIPS TO CHOOSE THE WOMAN’S HANDBAG
In choosing a women bag, there must not be always easy. Women have their own consideration and it can be shape, color, price, and even shop or the place that they can buy. Below are some tips that I choose as the reference which might help those who feel confuse to choose a handbag.
Shape. Watch your need to pick the right handbag. It does not much different as you do when you choose sweater in a cold weather rather than choose pajamas. So, when you emphasize the handbag for going to work, don’t choose the bag that equal to wedding party handbag. 
Color. Every handbag usually has more than more color. Women look more interesting about the black handbag because it seems to be more glamorous and luxurious. The black color makes the user become easy in combining with their dress. But it cannot close the possibility that the other colors will make the beauty and the luxurious of the handbag also emitted.
 Price. The bag with a high price is usually has the higher quality. But, that perception will not always be right. You need to analyze the bag well and do not hang the quality just based on the price. There must be many high quality handbags which come with a low price.
 Shop. Nowadays, online shop has got a higher popularity rather than offline shop. It able to understand because picking a handbag in online shop is always be easier than offline shop. But you need to ensure the quality when go shopping there. Every of us know that the product in online shop will only be seen from its color and its shape. While, we cannot touch it so the quality of its material still be mysterious. So, be careful.
Hopefully, all those tips are able to help you in picking the right handbag.</a>

                                            Expression Expressing Obligations Pay attention to the dialogs in Activity 2. The sentences "We must lock the gate before leaving, for safety", "We must spray the door handle with disinfectant.", "We must protect ourselves from bacteria and viruses.", "You have to take off your cap before entering the ATM booth." and "We have to wash our hands before entering the building." are used to express obligations. Study other expressions of obligations as follows. Table 3. 1 Expressions of obligations and suitable responses Responding • All students have to attend the class at 7 AM. • Road users must stop when a traffic light turns red. We have to return the books to the library before the borrowing period is up or we have to pay a fine. . It is necessary that we follow this guideline. It is my responsibility to tidy up the table. It's my duty to do it. ● • . Expressing Obligations We must throw rubbish into trashcans. I must learn English for a better future. ● . That's right. I must edit the pictures now. . • . Yeah! That's the rule. . Sure. Let's do it. • • You are right. English will provide us more chances. We have to obey the rules. . Sure. Otherwise, we might make an error. Good boy! I am proud of you. Grammar Modals 'Must' and 'Have to' We use 'must' and 'have/has to' to express obligations. Pattern: must, have to/has to + verb base 'Must' is a modal, while 'have to' is the word which functions as a modal. We use 'must' when we think it is necessary and it comes from the speakers. We use 'have to/has to' for external obligations (obligations that come from someone else) or when the necessity comes from the situation. Examples: Technology Literate Find information from websites about expressions of obligations. Rewrite the information using MS PowerPoint and share it with the class. We must clean the house every day. Students must be disciplined to achieve success. Drivers have to have driver's licenses. People have to undergo a screening test before vaccinated.tolong cari terjemahan bahasa Indonesia ny kak.....​</a>

                                            Drinking Water
Water becomes the popular drink after sot drink in some countries. People believe that it is good to drink eight glasses of water a day to keep our body moisturized and healthy. However, drinking eight glasses of water a day was nothing more than a guideline, not based on scientific evidence. Water gives us many benefits. First, water could aid weight loss. By drinking water before having a meal, you can lose your weight. This is because extra H2O helps us eatless by making us feel full and boost metabolism. Second, water keeps digest healthy. Water helps dissolve fats and soluble fiber. Water also flushes waste product that prevents constipation and reduce the burden on our kidneys and liver. The last, water prevents headache naturally. We sometimes get migraine. Migraine is caused, sometimes, by not drinking water for too long. Water helps our headache by drinking two to four cups of water for headache relief within one to two hours. Water is the healthiest beverage in the world. You will get nothing from water but benefits for your health.

The culture of Indonesia
The culture of Indonesia has been shaped by long interaction between original indigenous customs and multiple foreign influences. Indonesia is centrally-located along ancient trading routes between the Far East, South Asia, and the Middle East, resulting in many cultural practices being strongly influenced by a multitude of religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam, and Christianity, all strong in the major trading cities. The result is a complex cultural mixture very different from the original indigenous cultures.
Examples of the fusion of Islam with Hindu Javanese Abangan belief, the fusion of Hinduism, Buddhism and animism in Bodha, and the fusion of Hinduism and animism in Kaharingan. Balinese dances have stories about ancient Buddhist, and Hindu kingdoms, while Islamic art forms and architecture are present in Sumatra, especially in the Minangkabau and Aceh regions. Traditional art, music, and sport are combined in a martial art form called Pencak Silat.
The Western world has influenced Indonesia in science, technology and modern entertainment such as television shows, film, and music, as well as political system and issues. India has notably influenced Indonesian songs and movies. A popular type of song is the Indian-rhythmical dangdut, which is often mixed with Arab and Malay folk music.
Despite the influences of foreign culture, some remote Indonesian regions still preserve uniquely indigenous culture. Indigenous ethnic groups Mentawai, Asmat, Dani, Dayak, Toraja, and many others are still practicing their ethnic rituals, customs and wearing traditional clothes.
Drinking Water
Water becomes the popular drink after soft drink in some countries. People believe that it is good to drink eight glasses of water a day to keep our body moisturized and healthy. However, drinking eight glasses of water a day was nothing more than a guideline, not based on scientific evidence. Water gives us many benefits.
 First, water could aid weight loss. By drinking water before having a meal, you can lose your weight. This is because extra H2O helps us eatless by making us feel full and boost metabolism. Second, water keeps digest healthy. Water helps dissolve fats and soluble fiber. Water also flushes waste product that prevents constipation and reduce the burden on our kidneys and liver. 
The last, water prevents headache naturally. We sometimes get migraine. Migraine is caused, sometimes, by not drinking water for too long. Water helps our headache by drinking two to four cups of water for headache relief within one to two hours. Water is the healthiest beverage in the world. You will get nothing from water but benefits for your health.
TIPS TO CHOOSE THE WOMAN’S HANDBAG
In choosing a women bag, there must not be always easy. Women have their own consideration and it can be shape, color, price, and even shop or the place that they can buy. Below are some tips that I choose as the reference which might help those who feel confuse to choose a handbag.

                            23. Expression Expressing Obligations Pay attention to the dialogs in Activity 2. The sentences "We must lock the gate before leaving, for safety", "We must spray the door handle with disinfectant.", "We must protect ourselves from bacteria and viruses.", "You have to take off your cap before entering the ATM booth." and "We have to wash our hands before entering the building." are used to express obligations. Study other expressions of obligations as follows. Table 3. 1 Expressions of obligations and suitable responses Responding • All students have to attend the class at 7 AM. • Road users must stop when a traffic light turns red. We have to return the books to the library before the borrowing period is up or we have to pay a fine. . It is necessary that we follow this guideline. It is my responsibility to tidy up the table. It's my duty to do it. ● • . Expressing Obligations We must throw rubbish into trashcans. I must learn English for a better future. ● . That's right. I must edit the pictures now. . • . Yeah! That's the rule. . Sure. Let's do it. • • You are right. English will provide us more chances. We have to obey the rules. . Sure. Otherwise, we might make an error. Good boy! I am proud of you. Grammar Modals 'Must' and 'Have to' We use 'must' and 'have/has to' to express obligations. Pattern: must, have to/has to + verb base 'Must' is a modal, while 'have to' is the word which functions as a modal. We use 'must' when we think it is necessary and it comes from the speakers. We use 'have to/has to' for external obligations (obligations that come from someone else) or when the necessity comes from the situation. Examples: Technology Literate Find information from websites about expressions of obligations. Rewrite the information using MS PowerPoint and share it with the class. We must clean the house every day. Students must be disciplined to achieve success. Drivers have to have driver's licenses.

Alternative minimum tax (AMT)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>a. A lessee is a person or organization that rents or leases property or equipment from a lessor.</p><p></p><p>b. An operating lease is a lease agreement in which the lessor retains ownership of the leased asset and the lessee pays rent to use the asset for a specified period of time. Operating leases are typically used for short-term rentals or for equipment that is expected to become obsolete or depreciate quickly.</p><p></p><p>c. Capitalizing refers to the process of recording an asset as a long-term, fixed asset on a company's balance sheet, rather than as an expense on the income statement. Capitalizing an asset allows a company to spread the cost of the asset over its useful life, rather than expensing it all in the year it was acquired.</p><p></p><p>d. FASB Statement 13, also known as the Accounting for Leases, is a set of accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The statement outlines the accounting treatment for leases and requires companies to disclose information about their leases in their financial statements.</p><p></p><p>e. A guideline lease is a lease that meets certain criteria that make it more favorable for the lessee from a financial perspective. These criteria may include the length of the lease, the amount of rent paid, and the type of asset being leased.</p><p></p><p>f. Residual value is the estimated value of an asset at the end of its useful life. In a lease agreement, the residual value is used to determine the amount of rent that the lessee will pay over the term of the lease.</p><p></p><p>g. Lessee's analysis is the process of evaluating the financial implications of entering into a lease agreement from the perspective of the lessee. This analysis may involve comparing the costs of leasing to the costs of purchasing the asset, as well as considering the tax implications of the lease.</p><p></p><p>h. Net advantage to leasing (NAL) is a measure of the financial benefits of leasing versus buying an asset. The NAL is calculated by subtracting the total cost of leasing from the total cost of purchasing the asset over the same period of time.</p><p></p><p>i. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a tax that is applied to individuals and corporations that have high levels of income but also have a large number of deductions or credits, which can reduce their tax liability. The AMT is intended to ensure that these individuals and corporations pay at least a minimum amount of tax.</p><br />
